# 💹 Crypto Asset Dashboard

A responsive and interactive dashboard built with React that displays real-time cryptocurrency data including price, volume, and historical trends. This app fetches data from the CoinGecko API and visualizes price movement using Chart.js.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **React** – Frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Axios** – HTTP client for API calls
- **Chart.js + react-chartjs-2** – For rendering price movement charts
- **CoinGecko API** – Public API for cryptocurrency market data

## 🎨 UI Decisions

- **Tailwind CSS** was used to ensure quick styling and full responsiveness across screen sizes.
- **Dark theme** UI was chosen for a modern look and better contrast for charts.
- A **dropdown selector** allows users to switch between multiple cryptocurrencies easily.
- The **line chart** provides a clear view of price trends over the past 7 days.
- Modular components (`Dropdown`, `CryptoInfo`, `PriceChart`, `PriceList`) make the UI clean and maintainable.

## 🚀 What I'd Enhance With More Time

- 🔍 **Search functionality** to allow users to query any crypto, not just pre-selected ones
- 📈 Add **more detailed chart analytics** (volume overlays, zoom/pan features)
- 🌙 **Dark/light mode toggle**
- 🧪 **Unit tests and integration tests** for components
- 📦 Deployment-ready configuration (e.g., hosted on Vercel or GitHub Pages)
- 🧠 Integrate **AI-generated crypto summaries** using an LLM like Gemini or OpenAI
